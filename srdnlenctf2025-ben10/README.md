**Challenge description** : Ben Tennyson's Omnitrix holds a mysterious and powerful form called Materia Grigia — a creature that only those with the sharpest minds can access. It's hidden deep within the system, waiting for someone clever enough to unlock it. Only the smartest can access what’s truly hidden.
